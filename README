Catalyst-Engine-Stomp
=====================

This is a Catalyst engine which allows you to build a message-driven
application with STOMP. 

Controllers indicate queues, and message types indicate actions. A
controller base class is provided to handle YAML-serialized messages.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

     YAML::XS
     Data::Serializer
     Catalyst::Engine::Embeddable
     Catalyst::Runtime 5.80003
